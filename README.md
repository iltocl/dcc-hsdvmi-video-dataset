This repository documents the construction of a **Mexican Spanish Video Dataset** that aims to be used for the **hate speech detection task** in computer science.

The construction of the dataset consists of the following phases:
1. Collecting the videos (In progress...)
[] 1.1 Delimiting a list of hate speech (HS) words to be used as seeds
[] 1.2 Retrieve YT videos using a hate speech words list
[] 1.3 Choose relevant videos from the retrieved YT ones
[] 1.4 Use relevant videos as seeds to get more related videos
2. Prepare the videos
   2.1 Segment each of the videos into 1-minute length
3. Annotating the videos
   3.1
4. Formalizing the dataset
