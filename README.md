This repository documents the construction of a **Mexican Spanish Video Dataset** that aims to be used for the **hate speech detection task** in computer science.

The construction of the dataset consists of the following phases:
1. Collecting the videos (In progress...)
    1.1 Delimiting a list of hate speech (HS) words to be used as seeds
    1.2          
3. Annotating the videos
4. Formalizing the dataset
